> Latest exchange rates

## Goal
Learning new things through a JS frontend project

I'm gonna use https://exchangeratesapi.io/ to spin up a web page that gives the latest exchange rate between any two currencies.

## Commands

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report

# run unit tests
npm run unit

# run all tests
npm test

# rune linter
npm run lint -- --fix
```

For a detailed explanation on how things work, check out the [guide](http://vuejs-templates.github.io/webpack/) and [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).

## Building blocks

- Vue JS

- ESlint enforcing Airbnb style

- Overpass font and Overpass Mono font

- Date-fns

## What I learned

### Vue
Having tried AngularJS, Angular 2 and React, I went with Vue this time. A single simple page is exceedingly easy to make. I'm curious to see how it scales to complicated web apps.

### CSS
Very often I used to rely on UI components libraries to style basic things like buttons and forms. I made an effort this time to only use vanilla CSS to style the ```select``` components and the rest of the page.

### Syntax
I was not accustomed to trailing commas, spaces after if and semi-colons. Those are all strictly enforced by the Arbnb style. I feel more confortable with this code style. The linter is a godsend, it takes you by the hand and enforces a welcomed coherence.
