> Latest exchange rates

Learning new things through a JS frontend project

I'm gonna use https://exchangeratesapi.io/ to spin up a webapp that gives the latest exchange rate between any two currencies.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report

# run unit tests
npm run unit

# run all tests
npm test

# rune linter
npm run lint -- --fix
```

For a detailed explanation on how things work, check out the [guide](http://vuejs-templates.github.io/webpack/) and [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).

## Learning

Vue JS
Forcing myself to write Airbnb style JS using ESlint. I was not accustomed to trailing commas, spaces after if and semi-colons.
